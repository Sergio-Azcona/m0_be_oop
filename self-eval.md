# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
-i feel more comfortable after being able to review and digest the concepts
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
i am taking more breaks now which decreases the frustration when i do run into issues
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
i will need to take a day (or most of it) off on the weekends in order to decompress and let the theories settle in. i also need to avoid stressing myself overall :)
